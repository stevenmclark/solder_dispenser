A re-useable, 3D printed solder dispenser

Solder is often available by the pound on spools. This is very convenient if one uses a lot of solder wire, but for folks that need smaller amounts for makerspaces, academic labs, etc. a spool of solder can be too large a quantity for easy handling. While there are smaller "pocket pack" size packages available, these aren't typically available with the type of flux favored by some. For example, the lead-free solder available from Kester in the "pocket pack" has a rosin core; for our work we prefer water-soluble flux for easy cleaning without the use of organic solvents.  

The lack of limited quantity packaging led to the creation of a simple easy to use package that can be 3D printed with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) filament materials. The design targets re-use by re-spooling solder wire from a 1 lb. spool.  

TPU is available in a variety of colors enabling the use of color coding to designate lead-free solder and wire diameter; we find that 0.020" diameter solder wire is helpful for fine work and 0.031" diameter solder wire is helpful for typical through-hole soldering. We favor SAC 305 (96.5% tin / 3% silver / 0.5% copper) with water soluble flux cored solder for our lead-free work. So, for example, lead-free solder has one component made from green filament and the solder diameter is indicated by the color of the other component: a green and lavender solder dispenser would be 0.020" diameter lead-free (SAC 305) with a water-soluble flux core.  

We print the components from two different formulations of TPU: the "base" is made from a "harder" (higher durometer -95A) TPU filament while the "cover" is made of a "softer" 85A durometer TPU filament.  

The dispensers can be re-wound with the correct solder wire when they have run empty.
